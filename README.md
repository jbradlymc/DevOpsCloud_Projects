Hi! I created this repository to build hands-on projects while learning networking, Linux, 
Python automation, monitoring, and cloud infrastructure.  

The projects are designed to gradually progress from basic networking and system administration to 
automation, observability, and cloud deployment, giving practical experience aligned with real-world 
DevOps and Cloud workflows.


Progress tracking:
Feb 01, 2026 - repo creation
Feb 07, 2026 - Level1 Build part done
